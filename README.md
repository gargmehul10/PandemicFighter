# PandemicFighter
- An application which ensures that people have access to all the essential items following the norms of social-distancing. It prevents the shortage of daily essentials by keeping a check on panic-buying. It also provides a platform for users to contact NGOs if they wish to provide aid to the needy. We hope that our application can prove to be a useful tool in the fight against COVID-19.
